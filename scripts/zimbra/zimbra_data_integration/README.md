# Zimbra Collaboration Suite scripts for Sys Admins

## Data Transformation and Integration using PDI - Pentaho Data Integration (Kettle)

I'm developing a way to consolidate and centralize Zimbra Report, then create
an Dataware House with an Dimensional Modeling.

After all, I could extract more information of my Email Infrastructure using, for 
example, Mondrian (Pentaho Suite)


Plans to do
* Control MTA report
* Control LDAP Base
