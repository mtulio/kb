# get_System_Information.sh

Get TCP and Sockets information from your Linux System, and
then, if you set option -s, you can save the current data to a file
See FILE_STDOUT to change filename.
You'll get more if:
	-> run it by super user (eg.: root)
	-> use watch to see in real time and constantly update
	-> schedule, with -s option, in crontab to see logs later (Needs to finish, standarize, the log output)

See an sample output running by root [and using watch to refresh data every a second]:
```
[root@mtnote system_socket_information]# watch -n1 ./get_System_Information.sh 
Every 1,0s: ./get_System_Information.sh                                                                            Thu Aug 27 23:04:09 2015
